# FKey

# Goal

FKey is a fork of German keyboard layout for TempleOS.
The goal is to bring the Azerty layout (ISO) to TempleOS and ZealOS.

# Important Informations

Azerty layout is fully ported for ZealOS (HomeKeyPlugIns.ZC), but the TempleOS version is the older one I made (not a full port).

I should port it fully on Vanilla TempleOS soon and rebuild an ISO.

For now, use ZealOS for full Azerty support.

# Installation

For TempleOS you can use the ISO and include the installer, but it's not the full layout.

For ZealOS you'll need to access your virtual hard drive.

For VDI you can use Daemon Tool. For qcow, there is some ways (look at TSoding gitlab, he uses some scripts to mount the disk).
