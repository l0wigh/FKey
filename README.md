# FKey

# Goal

FKey is a fork of German keyboard layout for Temple OS.
The goal is to bring the azerty keyboard to Temple OS (at least for the layout, maybe not the accentuated char).

The layout isn't totally like the AZERTY one, but it's the closest I got, just open the HomeKeyPlugIns file to see what changes are made.
# Installation

Here is a set of commands that should allow you to install FKey:

    Cd("T:");
    #include "Setup.HC.Z";
    
This script will copy the HomeKeyPlugIns.HC to your Home directory for you.
You are free to copy the file manually as well.

To uninstall, just delete HomeKeyPlugIns.HC from your Home directory
